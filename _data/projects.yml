  description: "Model-based Cross-Cloud Development and Deployment Platform.
    The project provides an open source integrated platform to
    support design, model-based development,
    configuration, optimization and deployment of
    existing and new Cloud applications independently
    of the existing underlying Cloud infrastructures."

- name: CloudSocket
  description: "Business and IT-Cloud Alignment using a Smart Socket.
    This project investigates the concept of Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) by creating
    environments for the different stages, i.e. from the modelling of business processes up
    to their execution as a service in the Cloud."

- name: CloudPerfect
  description: "CLOUDPERFECT aims at delivering a set of tools and processes that will enable a) Cloud providers to
    enhance the stability and performance effectiveness of their infrastructures, through modelling and
    understanding of the overheads and optimal groupings of concurrently running services, runtime
    analysis and adaptation, thus gaining a competitive advantage b) Cloud adopters to understand the
    computational nature of their applications, investigate abstracted and understandable QoS metrics and
    how respective providers rank in them, how to balance their selection between cost and performance to
    optimize their competitiveness and monitor the maintenance of their SLA c) 3rd parties to act as
    independent validators of Cloud QoS features, enabling new business models through a constant
    monitoring, benchmarking and evaluation process, filling a large gap in the current
    brokerage/consultancy domain especially in the fields of performance evaluation and SLA auditing."

- name: Melodic
  description: "The MELODIC platform will enable data-intensive applications to run within defined
    security, cost, and performance boundaries seamlessly on geographically distributed and federated
    cloud infrastructures. MELODIC will thereby realise the potential of heterogeneous cloud environments
    for big data and data-intensive applications by transparently taking advantage of distinct characteristics
    of available private and public clouds, dynamically optimise resource utilisation, consider data locality,
    conform to the user’s privacy needs and service requirements, and counter vendor lock-in. Hence,
    the main objective of the MELODIC project is
    to enable data-aware application deployments on geographically distributed and federated cloud infrastructures."
